| Case Study: Supervised Binary Domain Image-to-Image Translation w. Pix2Pix cGAN | Conduct a case study on supervised Image-to-Image Translation on a paired/two-domain dataset using a conditional generative adversarial, formally called Pix2Pix. The network architecture is reproduced using the proposed model by Philip Isola, then implemented on a cityscape paired  dataset.  The  network  is  trained with an objective to perform image to image translation from a semantic annotated urban street image to a realistic urban street image. |
